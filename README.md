# CFD-Thermal-Fin-Analysis
## 📖 Introduction
This project focuses on the **steady-state thermal analysis of fins** using ANSYS Workbench 2025 R1 (Student Version).  
Fins are widely used in engineering applications to enhance heat transfer, such as in radiators, heat exchangers, and electronic cooling systems.  

## 🛠️ Methodology
- Software: **ANSYS Workbench 2025 R1 (Student Version)**
- Type of Analysis: **Steady-State Thermal**
- Geometry: Array of rectangular fins on a base plate
- Boundary Conditions:
  - Base temperature applied
  - Convection on fin surfaces  

## 📊 Results
- **Maximum Temperature:** 200 °C  
- **Minimum Temperature:** 174.32 °C  
- **Average Temperature:** 187.73 °C  

The results show effective heat dissipation along the fins, with temperature decreasing from the base towards the tip.  

## 🎯 Conclusion
This simulation demonstrates the role of fins in enhancing heat transfer. The analysis helps in optimizing fin design for improved cooling performance in practical applications.
